/**
 * Describes the various match levels describing how two records resolve against each other.  The possible values are:   * `NO_MATCH` - No match was found between the records.   * `RESOLVED` - The records resolved to the same entity.   * `POSSIBLY_SAME` - The records were not close enough to resolve     but may represent the same entity if more data was provided.   * `POSSIBLY_RELATED` - The records share some attributes that     suggest a relationship.   * `NAME_ONLY` - The records match in name only.   * `DISCLOSED` - An explicit relationship has been disclosed between     the records.
