/**
 * Describes the type of bound for a range. Possible values are:   * `INCLUSIVE_LOWER` - The bound represents an inclusive lower bound whereby                         values satisfying the bound will be greater-than or equal                         to the value associated with the bound.   * `EXCLUSIVE_LOWER` - The bound represents an exclusive lower bound whereby                          values satisfying the bound will be strictly greater-than                          the value associated with the bound.   * `INCLUSIVE_UPPER` - The bound represents an inclusive upper bound whereby                         values satisfying the bound will be less-than or equal                         to the value associated with the bound.   * `EXCLUSIVE_UPPER` - The bound represents an exclusive upper bound whereby                          values satisfying the bound will be strictly less-than                          the value associated with the bound.
